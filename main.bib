abstract = {Nowadays the deployment and commissioning of complex production processes or Internet-enabled applications interacting with production systems requires a time consuming and error-prone manual system configuration process. This is due to the need to maintain a high level of determinism, safety, and security of the production process itself and avoiding both safety-critical failures and costly production interruptions. The project “IoT@Work - Internet of Things at Work” aims at delivering tools and runtime mechanisms to significantly simplify commissioning, operating, and maintaining complex production processes, thus enabling Plug-and-Produce for automation systems. This paper presents a novel approach for the autoconfiguration of real-time Ethernet systems, and all relevant mechanisms. A case study, based on Profinet IO, evaluates the approach and shows its feasibility.},

abstract = {Nowadays, industrial control systems operators are trying to fulfill requirements from upcoming standards and regulation regarding cyber security issues. However, addressing such security requirements by implementing security measures is not a trivial task. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of the configuration for the security measures is prone to error. This research shows that it is possible to derive configuration file(s) to setup different security measures based on the input from system description files. In addition, we highlight an important anomaly in industrial control systems, namely the missing/tardiness of expected traffic. In this paper, we show how the proposed system works by taking IEC 61850 SCD files and generating configuration files for security measures such as firewall and IDS/IPS. Additionally, current IDS/IPS only raise an alert when unexpected traffic appears in the system. They do not alert on the disappearance of the expected traffic. In fact, this type of anomaly is as critical as the other type of anomaly. Thus, we address this anomaly as well in our research.},

In this paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Intrusion Detection Systems. The aim is to be able to detect complex attacks to SCADA systems, by monitoring its state evolution. By complex attack, we mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system.

abstract = {During the last decade with the growth of cyber attacks, information safety has become an important issue all over the world. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are an essential element for network security infrastructure and play a very important role in detecting large number of attacks. Although there are different types of intrusion detection systems, all these systems suffer a common problem which is generating high volume of alerts and huge number of false positives. This drawback has become the main motivation for many research papers in IDS area. The aim of conducted research in the field is to propose different techniques to handle the alerts, reduce them and distinguish real attacks from false positives and low importance events. This manuscript is a survey paper that represents a review of the current research related to the false positives problem. The focus will be on data mining techniques of alert reduction. This paper reviews more than 30 related studies during the last decade with the hope of providing a reference for further research in this area. Several open issues have also been addressed in this paper.},

abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are used to monitor computer systems for signs of security violations. Having detected such signs, IDSs trigger alerts to report them. These alerts are presented to a human analyst, who evaluates them and initiates an adequate response. In practice, IDSs have been observed to trigger thousands of alerts per day, most of which are mistakenly triggered by benign events (i.e., false positives). This makes it extremely difficult for the analyst to correctly identify alerts related to attacks (i.e., true positives). In this paper, we present two orthogonal and complementary approaches to reduce the number of false positives in intrusion detection using alert postprocessing by data mining and machine learning. Moreover, these two techniques, because of their complementary nature, can be used together in an alert-management system. These concepts have been verified on a variety of data sets, and achieved a significant reduction in the number of false positives in both simulated and real environments. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The former have the advantage of attack specificity, but may not be able to generalize. The latter detect attacks probabilistically, allowing for generalization potential. However, they lack attack models and can potentially learn to consider an attack normal. Herein, we present a high-performance, adaptive, model-based technique for attack detection, using Bayes net technology to analyze bursts of traffic. Attack classes are embodied as model hypotheses, which are adaptively reinforced. This approach has the attractive features of both signature based and statistical techniques: model specificity, adaptability, and generalization potential. Our initial prototype sensor examines TCP headers and communicates in IDIP, delivering a complementary inference technique to an IDS sensor suite.

abstract = {False positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) happen in every Intrusion Detection System (IDS). How often they occur is regarded as a measurement of the accuracy of the system. Frequent occurrences of FPs not only reduce the throughput of an IDS as FPs block the normal traffic and also degrade its trustworthiness. It is also difficult to eradicate all FNs from an IDS. One way to overcome the shortcomings of a single IDS is to employ multiple IDSs in its place and leverage the different capabilities and domain knowledge of these systems. Nonetheless, making a correct intrusion decision based on the outcomes of multiple IDSs has been a challenging task, as different IDSs may respond differently to the same packet trace. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce FPs and FNs by applying a creditability-based weighted voting (CWV) scheme to the outcomes of multiple IDSs. First, the CWV scheme evaluates the creditability of each individual IDS by monitoring its response to a large collection of pre-recorded packet traces containing various types of intrusions. For each IDS, our scheme then assigns different weights to each intrusion type according to its FP and FN ratios. Later, after their operations, the outcomes of individual IDSs are merged using a weighted voting scheme. In benchmarking tests, our CWV-based multiple IDSs demonstrated significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency when compared with multiple IDSs employing an ordinary majority voting (MV) scheme. The accuracy is the percentage of whole traces that are determined accurately, while the efficiency indicates that the voting algorithm performs better on reducing both FP and FN ratios. The CWV scheme achieved 95{\%} accuracy and 94{\%} efficiency while the MV scheme produced only 66{\%} accuracy and 41{\%} efficiency; the average percentages of FP/FN reduction were 21{\%} and 58{\%} respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of such Internet of Things (IoT) on our society will be extraordinary. It will influence most consumer and business sectors, impact education, healthcare and safety. However, it certainly will also pose a challenge from a security point of view. Not only will the devices themselves become more complex, also the interaction between devices, the networks and the vari-ance in topology will grow. Finally, with increasing amounts of data and assets at stake the incentive for attackers will increase. The costs of cyber attacks in such setting are esti-mated to reach about 2 trillion USD by 2020. Today, the IoT is just beginning to emerge. Unfortu-nately, when looking at its security, there is lots of room for improvement. Exploits reported at a steady pace clearly suggest that security is a major challenge when the world wants to successfully switch from an IoT hype to a real IoT deployment. Security, and security risk awareness, insuffi-ciently present in today's consumer and developer mindset, are only a starting point. Once the requirement for strong security is widely accepted, there will be still the economical question of who is going to pay for security and its main-tenance. Without enforcing certain standards by means of third party evaluation this problem is expected to be hard to get under control. However, awareness and obligatory security levels do not remove the complexity from creating secure solutions. There-fore, most of the complexity needs to be abstracted by suit-able platforms. Amongst other vital features such platforms need to provide a secure software update mechanism, a se-cure, yet convenient device pairing mechanism and the in-tegration into a trust provisioning infrastructure. Further-more, standards need to be decimated to an interoperable set which can be supported by such platforms. Another interesting question evolves around hardware ver-sus software security.

The contents of the respective legislation must encompass the right to information, provisions prohibiting or restricting the use of mechanisms of the Internet of Things, rules on IT-security-legislation, provisions supporting the use of mechanisms of the Internet of Things and the establishment of a task force doing research on the legal challenges of the IoT.},

Ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, Internet Protocol, sensing technologies, communication technologies, and embedded devices are merged together in order to form a system where the real and digital worlds meet and are continuously in symbiotic interaction. The smart object is the building block of the IoT vision. By putting intelligence into everyday objects, they are turned into smart objects able not only to collect information from the environment and interact/control the physical world, but also to be interconnected, to each other, through Internet to exchange data and information. The expected huge number of interconnected devices and the significant amount of available data open new opportunities to create services that will bring tangible benefits to the society, environment, economy and individual citizens. In this paper we present the key features and the driver technologies of IoT. In addition to identifying the application scenarios and the correspondent potential applications, we focus on research challenges and open issues to be faced for the IoT realization in the real world.},

abstract = {—Computer-aided design (CAD), in its quest to facil-itate new design revolutions, is again on the brink of changing its scope. Following both historical and recent technological and application trends, one can identify several emerging research and development directions in which CAD approaches and techniques may have major impacts. Among them, due to the potential to fundamentally alter everyday life as well as how science and engineering systems are designed and operated, the Internet of Things (IoT) stands out. IoT also poses an extraordinary system replete with conceptual and technical challenges. For instance, greatly reduced quantitative bounds on acceptable area and energy metrics require qualitative breakthroughs in design and optimization techniques. Most likely the most demanding of requirements for the widespread realization of many IoT visions is security. IoT secu-rity has an exceptionally wide scope in at least four dimensions. In terms of security scope it includes rarely addressed tasks such as trusted sensing, computation, communication, privacy, and digital forgetting. It also asks for new and better techniques for the protection of hardware, software, and data that considers the possibility of physical access to IoT devices. Sensors and actuators are common components of IoT devices and pose several unique security challenges including the integrity of physical signals and actuating events. Finally, during processing of collected data, one can envision many semantic attacks. Our strategic objective is to provide an impetus for the development of IoT CAD security techniques. We start by presenting a brief survey of IoT challenges and opportunities with an emphasis on security issues. Next, we discuss the potential of hardware-based IoT security approaches. Finally, we conclude with several case studies that advocate the use of stable PUFs and digital PPUFs for several IoT security protocols.},

However, there are not enough security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets. For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach will provide significant contributions to attract attention to vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems.},

Due to the increasing scale and complexity of software today, manually locating faults when failures occur is rapidly becoming infeasible, and consequently, there is a strong demand for techniques that can guide software developers to the locations of faults in a program with minimal human intervention. This demand in turn has fueled the proposal and development of a broad spectrum of fault localization techniques, each of which aims to streamline the fault localization process and make it more effective by attacking the problem in a unique way.

abstract = {Wang et al. (Softw. Pract. Exper. 2007; 37(7):727–745) observed a phenomenon of performance inconsistency in the graphics of Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)/Swing among different Java runtime environments (JREs) on Windows XP. This phenomenon makes it difficult to predict the performance of Java game applications. Therefore, they proposed a portable AWT/Swing architecture, called CYC Window Toolkit (CWT), to provide programmers with high and consistent rendering performance for Java game development among different JREs. They implemented a DirectX version to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture. This paper extends the above research to other environments in two aspects. First, we evaluate the rendering performance of the original Java AWT with different combinations of JREs, image application programming interfaces, system properties and operating systems (OSs), including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Fedora and Mac OS X. The evaluation results indicate that the performance inconsistency of Java AWT also exists among the four OSs, even if the same hardware configuration is used. Second, we design an OpenGL version of CWT, named CWT-GL, to take advantage of modern 3D graphics cards, and compare the rendering performance of CWT with Java AWT/Swing. The results show that CWT-GL achieves more consistent and higher rendering performance in JREs 1.4 to 1.6 on the four OSs. The results also hint at two approaches: (a) decouple the rendering pipelines of Java AWT/Swing from the JREs for faster upgrading and supporting old JREs and (b) use other graphics libraries, such as CWT, instead of Java AWT/Swing to develop cross-platform Java games with higher and more consistent rendering performance.

abstract = {In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Considering this problem, several approaches for feature location using execution traces have been developed. Nonetheless, the practice of post-mortem analysis based on execution traces is not fully incorporated in the daily practice of software maintainers. Empirical studies that reveal strengths and weaknesses on the use of execution traces in maintenance activities could better explain the role of execution traces in software maintenance. This study reports on a controlled experiment conducted with maintainers performing actual maintenance activities on systems of different sizes unknown to them. There are benefits from systematic use of execution traces: the reduction of the maintenance activity time and greater accuracy of the activity outcome. Other qualitative observations were the lower level of activity difficulty perceived by the participants that used execution trace information and that this kind of information seems to be less useful in maintenance activities where the problem of feature scattering does not occur clearly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Different studies show that programmers are more interested in finding definitions of functions and their uses than variables, statements, or arbitrary code fragments [30, 29, 31]. Therefore, programmers require support in finding relevant functions and determining how those functions are used. Unfortunately, existing code search engines do not provide enough of this support to developers, thus reducing the effectiveness of code reuse. We provide this support to programmers in a code search system called Portfolio that retrieves and visualizes relevant functions and their usages. We have built Portfolio using a combination of models that address surfing behavior of programmer and sharing Related concepts among functions. We conducted an experiment with 49 professional programmers to compare Portfolio to Google Code Search and Koders using a standard methodology. The results show with strong statistical significance that users find more relevant functions with higher precision with Portfolio than with Google Code Search and Koders.},

They may hinder the evolution of a system by making it hard for software engineers to carry out changes. We propose three contributions to the research field related to code and design smells: (1) DECOR, a method that embodies and defines all the steps necessary for the specification and detection of code and design smells, (2) DETEX, a detection technique that instantiates this method, and (3) an empirical validation in terms of precision and recall of DETEX. The originality of DETEX stems from the ability for software engineers to specify smells at a high level of abstraction using a consistent vocabulary and domain-specific language for automatically generating detection algorithms. Using DETEX, we specify four well-known design smells: the antipatterns Blob, Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife, and their 15 underlying code smells, and we automatically generate their detection algorithms. We apply and validate the detection algorithms in terms of precision and recall on XERCES v2.7.0, and discuss the precision of these algorithms on 11 open-source systems.},

abstract = {—The challenge of inferring state machines from log data or execution traces is well-established, and has led to the development of several powerful techniques. Current approaches tend to focus on the inference of conventional finite state machines or, in few cases, state machines with guards. However, these ma-chines are ultimately only partial, because they fail to model how any underlying variables are computed during the course of an execution; they are not computational. In this paper we introduce a technique based upon Genetic Programming to infer these data transformation functions, which in turn render inferred automata fully computational. Instead of merely determining whether or not a sequence is possible, they can be simulated, and be used to compute the variable values throughout the course of an execution. We demonstrate the approach by using a Cross-Validation study to reverse-engineer complete (computational) EFSMs from traces of established implementations.},

abstract = {When reusing an existing software component, the software developer needs to understand the functionality and possible extension points of the component, as well as constraints and rules to be taken into account when using it. In addition to structural rules, the software component may imply interaction rules that must be followed in application development. In this paper we discuss behavioral profiles, given in UML, used to capture and illustrate architecturally significant behavioral rules. The behavioral rules may capture interaction rules to be obeyed when reusing an existing software component. They can also be used to support runtime analysis of existing systems: with a proper tool support, the validity of extracted interaction models can be automatically checked against the behavioral rules given in the profiles. Moreover, the profiles can be used to prune the size of the interaction trace to include only the information relevant from the point of view of the behavioral rules. In this paper we discuss such tool support and demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying behavioral profiles to define and illustrate behavioral rules relevant for applications using the graphical editing framework (GEF). Moreover, we analyze a sample GEF application by validating its run-time behaviour with respect to the defined behavioral rules},

abstract = {Illegal code reuse has become a serious threat to the software community. Identifying similar or identical code fragments becomes much more challenging in code theft cases where plagiarizers can use various automated code transformation or obfuscation techniques to hide stolen code from being detected. Previous works in this field are largely limited in that (i) most of them cannot handle advanced obfuscation techniques, and (ii) the methods based on source code analysis are not practical since the source code of suspicious programs typically cannot be obtained until strong evidences have been collected. Based on the observation that some critical runtime values of a program are hard to be replaced or eliminated by semantics-preserving transformation techniques, we introduce a novel approach to dynamic characterization of executable programs. Leveraging such invariant values, our technique is resilient to various control and data obfuscation techniques. We show how the values can be extracted and refined to expose the critical values and how we can apply this runtime property to help solve problems in software plagiarism detection. We have implemented a prototype with a dynamic taint analyzer atop a generic processor emulator. Our value-based plagiarism detection method (VaPD) uses the longest common subsequence based similarity measuring algorithms to check whether two code fragments belong to the same lineage. We evaluate our proposed method through a set of real-world automated obfuscators. Our experimental results show that the value-based method successfully discriminates 34 plagiarisms obfuscated by SandMark, plagiarisms heavily obfuscated by KlassMaster, programs obfuscated by Thicket, and executables obfuscated by Loco/Diablo.},

abstract = {One of the most important steps towards effective software maintenance of a large complicated system is to understand how program features are spread over the entire system and their interactions with the program components. However, we must first be able to represent an abstract feature in terms of some concrete program components. In this paper, we use an execution slice-based technique to identify the basic blocks which are used to implement a program feature. Three metrics are then defined, based on this identification, to determine quantitatively, the disparity between a program component and a feature, the concentration of a feature in a program component, and the dedication of a program component to a feature. The computations of these metrics are automated by incorporating them in a tool ($\chi$Suds), which makes the use of our metrics immediately applicable in real-life contexts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by experimenting with a reliability and performance evaluator. Results of our study suggest that these metrics can provide an indication of the closeness between a feature and a program component which is very useful for software programmers and maintainers to better understand the system at hand.},

abstract = {Finite state machine-derived specifications such as X-machines, extended finite state machines and abstract state machines, are an established means to model software behaviour. They allow for comprehensive testing of an implementation in terms of its intended behaviour. In practice however they are rarely generated and maintained during software development, hence their benefits can rarely be exploited. We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives. The technique has been implemented, which has enabled us to present a small case study of its use with respect to a real software system, along with some preliminary performance results.},

abstract = {Explicitly stated program invariants can help programmers by characterizing certain aspects of program execution and identifying program properties that must be preserved when modifying code. Unfortunately, these invariants are usually absent from code. Previous work showed how to dynamically detect invariants from program traces by looking for patterns in and relationships among variable values. A prototype implementation, Daikon, accurately recovered invariants from formally-specified programs, and the invariants it detected in other programs assisted programmers in a software evolution task. However, Daikon suffered from reporting too many invariants, many of which were not useful, and also failed to report some desired invariants. The paper presents, and gives experimental evidence of the efficacy of, four approaches for increasing the relevance of invariants reported by a dynamic invariant detector. One of them (exploiting unused polymorphism), adds desired invariants to the output. The other three (suppressing implied invariants, limiting which variables are compared to one another, and ignoring unchanged values), eliminate undesired invariants from the output and also improve runtime by reducing the work done by the invariant detector},

The main contribution of this paper is to provide a more robust alternative, whose most distinguishing characteristic is that it employs ranking heuristics to determine a code element's relevance to a feature. We believe that our technique is less sensitive with respect to the quality of the input and we claim that it is more effective when used by developers unfamiliar with the target system. We validate our claim by applying our technique to three systems with comprehensive test suites. A developer unfamiliar with the target system spent a limited amount of effort preparing the test suite for analysis. Our results show that under these circumstances our ranking-based technique compares favorably to a technique based on binary judgements.},

At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Malware analysis is the process of determining the purpose and functionality of a given malware sample (such as a virus,worm, orTrojan horse). This process is a necessary step to be able to develop effective detection techniques for malicious code. In addition, it is an important prerequisite for the development of removal tools that can thoroughly delete malware from an infected machine. Traditionally, malware analysis has been a manual process that is tedious and time- intensive. Unfortunately, the number of samples that need to be analyzed by security vendors on a daily basis is constantly increasing. This clearly reveals the need for tools that auto- mate and simplify parts of the analysis process. In this paper, we present TTAnalyze, a tool for dynamically analyzing the behavior of Windows executables. To this end, the binary is run in an emulated operating system environment and its (security-relevant) actions are monitored. In particular, we record the Windows native system calls and Windows API functions that the program invokes. One important feature of our system is that it does not modify the program that it executes (e.g., through API call hooking or breakpoints), makingitmoredifficult todetectbymalicious code. Also, our tool runs binaries in an unmodified Windows environment, which leads to excellent emulation accuracy. These factors make TTAnalyze an ideal tool for quickly understanding the behavior of an unknown malware.},

We have developed a set of command injection, data injection, and denial of service attacks which leverage the lack of authentication in many common control system communication protocols including MODBUS, DNP3, and EtherNET/IP. We used these exploits to aid in development of a neural network based intrusion detection system which monitors control system physical behavior to detect artifacts of command and response injection attacks.

The centralization of control and the movement towards open systems and standards has improved the efficiency of industrial control, but has also exposed legacy SCADA systems to security threats that they were not designed to mitigate. This work explores the viability of machine learning methods in detecting the new threat scenarios of command and data injection. Similar to network intrusion detection systems in the cyber security domain, the command and control communications in a critical infrastructure setting are monitored, and vetted against examples of benign and malicious command traffic, in order to identify potential attack events. Multiple learning methods are evaluated using a dataset of Remote Terminal Unit communications, which included both normal operations and instances of command and data injection attack scenarios.},

This paper will briefly discuss the history of research in intrusion detection techniques and introduce the two basic detection approaches: signature detection and anomaly detection. Finally, it presents the application of techniques developed for monitoring critical process systems, such as nuclear power plants, to anomaly intrusion detection. The method uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model coupled with the statistical probability ratio test (SPRT) and applied to a simulated SCADA system. The results show that these methods can be generally used to detect a variety of common attacks.},

SCADA systems are vital for operation and control of critical infrastructures, such as the electrical power system. Therefore, a number of standards and guidelines have been developed to support electric power utilities in their Cyber security efforts. This paper compares different SCADA Cyber security standards and guidelines with respect to threats and countermeasures they describe. Also, a comparison with the international standard ISO/IEC 17799 (now ISO/IEC 27002) is made. The method used is based on a comparison of use of certain key issues in the standards, after being grouped into different categories. The occurrences of the key issues are counted and comparisons are made. It is concluded that SCADA specific standards are more focused on technical countermeasures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection, whereas ISO/IEC 17799 is more focused on organizational countermeasures.},

The purpose is to study the impact of a cyber attack on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Compliance of the require- ment to meet the standard has become increasingly challenging as the system becomes more dispersed in wide areas. Interdepen- dencies between computer communication system and the phys- ical infrastructure also become more complex as information tech- nologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systemat- ically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access points. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its po- tential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks. Countermeasures are identified for improvement of the cybersecurity.},

Current EMS state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data, based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods can detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. To the authors best knowledge, this is the first such experimental study. The results indicate how state estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security attacks. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

The reliable operation of modern infrastructures depends on computerized systems and SCADA systems. Since the emergence of Internet and World Wide Web technologies, these systems were integrated with business systems and became more exposed to cyber threats. There is a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 document est ablished the framework to protect the critical infrastruct ure an d the Presidential document of 2003, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace stated that securing SCADA systems is a national priority. T he critical infrastructure includes telecommunication, transportation, energy, banking, finance, water supply, emergency services, government services, agriculture, an d other fundamental systems and services that are critical to the security, economic prosperity, and social well-being of the public. The critical infrastructure is characterized by interdependencies (physical, cyber, geographic, and logical) and complexity (collections of interacting components). Therefore, information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems without exception. Critical infrastructure disruptions can directly an d indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions, an d send ripples throughout the national an d global economy. For example, under normal operating conditions, the electric power in frastructure requires fuels (natural gas and petroleum), transportation, water, banking and finance, telecommunication, and SCADA systems for monitoring and control. In this paper, we provide an analysis of key developments, architecture, potential vulnerabilities, and security concerns including recommendations toward improving security for SCADA control systems. We discuss the most important issues concerning the security of SCADA systems including a perspective on enhancing security of these systems. We briefly describe the SCADA architecture, and identify t he attributes that increase the complexity of these systems including the key developments that mark the evolution of the SCADA control systems along with the growth of potential vulnerabilities and security concerns. Then, we provide recommendations toward an enhanced security for SCADA control systems. More efforts should be planned on reducing the vulnerabilities and improving the security operations of these systems. It is necessary to address not only t he individual vulnerabilit ies, but the breadth of risks that can interfere with critical operations. We describe key requirements and features needed to improve the security of t he current SCADA control systems. For example, in assessing the risk for SCADA systems, use of general methods for risk analysis including specific conditions and characteristics of a control system need to be applied. Effective risk analysis for SCADA systems requires a unified definition for mishap an d identification of potential harm to safety. As computer systems are more integrated, the distinction between security and safety is beginning to disappear. In bridging the gap between these domains, we propose a unified risk framework which combines a new definition of mishap with an expanded definition of hazard to include the security event. However, methods for risk management that are based on automated tools and intelligent techniques are more beneficial to SCADA systems because they require minimum or no human intervention in controlling the processes. We also identify a unified security/safety risk framework for control systems. Implementing security features ensures higher security, reliability, an d availability of control systems. Thus organizations need to reassess the SCADA control systems an d risk model to achieve in depth defense solutions for these systems. The increasing threats against SCADA control systems indicate that there should be more directions in the development of these systems. Therefore, achieving better quality an d more secure SCADA control systems is a high priority. Information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems with out exception. We conclude with a thought about the future of SCADA control systems. A strategy to deal with cyber attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure requires first understanding the full nature of the threat. A depth defense and proactive solutions to improve the security of SCADA control systems ensures the future of control systems and survivability of critical infrastructure.},

abstract = {Cyber security of Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems has become very important. SCADA systems are vital for operation and control of critical infrastructures, such as the electrical power system. Therefore, a number of standards and guidelines have been developed to support electric power utilities in their Cyber security efforts. This paper compares different SCADA Cyber security standards and guidelines with respect to threats and countermeasures they describe. Also, a comparison with the international standard ISO/IEC 17799 (now ISO/IEC 27002) is made. The method used is based on a comparison of use of certain key issues in the standards, after being grouped into different categories. The occurrences of the key issues are counted and comparisons are made. It is concluded that SCADA specific standards are more focused on technical countermeasures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection, whereas ISO/IEC 17799 is more focused on organizational countermeasures.},

Each security mechanism is contributed to enhance the SCADA system security, but at the same time, the mechanism is limited and depended on the other protocols for the purposes of message security, and its delivery. Few researches are conducted on security for SCADA broadcasting system, but these are limited to end-to-end designs and developments. The security developments for multicasting and broadcasting systems are much complicated, time consumed and/or overloaded with the cryptography mechanisms. After conducting the detail survey, a simulation environment for SCADA water pumping system is designed in-which number of nodes is configured and well known cryptography algorithms are selected, and deployed as an inclusive development for SCADA/DNP3 broadcasting system. The inclusive security development is considered with the best performance, and with predominant weakness in mind, which are present in SCADA/ DNP3 broadcasting system. However, overall communication is initiated, monitored and controlled at main controller side with the user defined human machine interface (HMI).},

Thus, we believe that model-based monitoring, which has the potential for detecting unknown attacks, is more feasible for control networks than for general enterprise networks.

abstract = {Vulnerability assessment is a requirement of NERC's cybersecurity standards for electric power systems. The purpose is to study the impact of a cyber attack on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Compliance of the require- ment to meet the standard has become increasingly challenging as the system becomes more dispersed in wide areas. Interdepen- dencies between computer communication system and the phys- ical infrastructure also become more complex as information tech- nologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systemat- ically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access points. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its po- tential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks. Countermeasures are identified for improvement of the cybersecurity.},

Current EMS state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data, based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods can detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. To the authors best knowledge, this is the first such experimental study. The results indicate how state estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security attacks. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

With the constantly growing number of internet related computer attacks, there is evidence that our critical infrastructure may also be vulnerable. Researchers estimate that malicious online actions may cause {\$}75 billion at 2007. One of the interesting countermeasures for enhancing information system security is called intrusion detection. This paper will briefly discuss the history of research in intrusion detection techniques and introduce the two basic detection approaches: signature detection and anomaly detection. Finally, it presents the application of techniques developed for monitoring critical process systems, such as nuclear power plants, to anomaly intrusion detection. The method uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model coupled with the statistical probability ratio test (SPRT) and applied to a simulated SCADA system. The results show that these methods can be generally used to detect a variety of common attacks.},

There is a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 document est ablished the framework to protect the critical infrastruct ure an d the Presidential document of 2003, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace stated that securing SCADA systems is a national priority. T he critical infrastructure includes telecommunication, transportation, energy, banking, finance, water supply, emergency services, government services, agriculture, an d other fundamental systems and services that are critical to the security, economic prosperity, and social well-being of the public. The critical infrastructure is characterized by interdependencies (physical, cyber, geographic, and logical) and complexity (collections of interacting components). Therefore, information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems without exception. Critical infrastructure disruptions can directly an d indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions, an d send ripples throughout the national an d global economy.

Then, we provide recommendations toward an enhanced security for SCADA control systems. More efforts should be planned on reducing the vulnerabilities and improving the security operations of these systems. It is necessary to address not only t he individual vulnerabilit ies, but the breadth of risks that can interfere with critical operations. We describe key requirements and features needed to improve the security of t he current SCADA control systems. For example, in assessing the risk for SCADA systems, use of general methods for risk analysis including specific conditions and characteristics of a control system need to be applied. Effective risk analysis for SCADA systems requires a unified definition for mishap an d identification of potential harm to safety. As computer systems are more integrated, the distinction between security and safety is beginning to disappear. In bridging the gap between these domains, we propose a unified risk framework which combines a new definition of mishap with an expanded definition of hazard to include the security event. However, methods for risk management that are based on automated tools and intelligent techniques are more beneficial to SCADA systems because they require minimum or no human intervention in controlling the processes. We also identify a unified security/safety risk framework for control systems. Implementing security features ensures higher security, reliability, an d availability of control systems. Thus organizations need to reassess the SCADA control systems an d risk model to achieve in depth defense solutions for these systems. The increasing threats against SCADA control systems indicate that there should be more directions in the development of these systems. Therefore, achieving better quality an d more secure SCADA control systems is a high priority. Information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems with out exception. We conclude with a thought about the future of SCADA control systems. A strategy to deal with cyber attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure requires first understanding the full nature of the threat. A depth defense and proactive solutions to improve the security of SCADA control systems ensures the future of control systems and survivability of critical infrastructure.},

abstract = {Cyber security of Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems has become very important. SCADA systems are vital for operation and control of critical infrastructures, such as the electrical power system. Therefore, a number of standards and guidelines have been developed to support electric power utilities in their Cyber security efforts. This paper compares different SCADA Cyber security standards and guidelines with respect to threats and countermeasures they describe. Also, a comparison with the international standard ISO/IEC 17799 (now ISO/IEC 27002) is made. The method used is based on a comparison of use of certain key issues in the standards, after being grouped into different categories. The occurrences of the key issues are counted and comparisons are made. It is concluded that SCADA specific standards are more focused on technical countermeasures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection, whereas ISO/IEC 17799 is more focused on organizational countermeasures.},

By complex attack, we mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system.

The impact of such Internet of Things (IoT) on our society will be extraordinary. It will influence most consumer and business sectors, impact education, healthcare and safety. However, it certainly will also pose a challenge from a security point of view. Not only will the devices themselves become more complex, also the interaction between devices, the networks and the vari-ance in topology will grow. Finally, with increasing amounts of data and assets at stake the incentive for attackers will increase. The costs of cyber attacks in such setting are esti-mated to reach about 2 trillion USD by 2020. Today, the IoT is just beginning to emerge. Unfortu-nately, when looking at its security, there is lots of room for improvement. Exploits reported at a steady pace clearly suggest that security is a major challenge when the world wants to successfully switch from an IoT hype to a real IoT deployment. Security, and security risk awareness, insuffi-ciently present in today's consumer and developer mindset, are only a starting point. Once the requirement for strong security is widely accepted, there will be still the economical question of who is going to pay for security and its main-tenance. Without enforcing certain standards by means of third party evaluation this problem is expected to be hard to get under control. However, awareness and obligatory security levels do not remove the complexity from creating secure solutions. There-fore, most of the complexity needs to be abstracted by suit-able platforms. Amongst other vital features such platforms need to provide a secure software update mechanism, a se-cure, yet convenient device pairing mechanism and the in-tegration into a trust provisioning infrastructure. Further-more, standards need to be decimated to an interoperable set which can be supported by such platforms. Another interesting question evolves around hardware ver-sus software security.

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

@article{Wang2009,
abstract = {Wang et al. (Softw. Pract. Exper. 2007; 37(7):727–745) observed a phenomenon of performance inconsistency in the graphics of Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)/Swing among different Java runtime environments (JREs) on Windows XP. This phenomenon makes it difficult to predict the performance of Java game applications. Therefore, they proposed a portable AWT/Swing architecture, called CYC Window Toolkit (CWT), to provide programmers with high and consistent rendering performance for Java game development among different JREs. They implemented a DirectX version to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture. This paper extends the above research to other environments in two aspects. First, we evaluate the rendering performance of the original Java AWT with different combinations of JREs, image application programming interfaces, system properties and operating systems (OSs), including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Fedora and Mac OS X. The evaluation results indicate that the performance inconsistency of Java AWT also exists among the four OSs, even if the same hardware configuration is used. Second, we design an OpenGL version of CWT, named CWT-GL, to take advantage of modern 3D graphics cards, and compare the rendering performance of CWT with Java AWT/Swing. The results show that CWT-GL achieves more consistent and higher rendering performance in JREs 1.4 to 1.6 on the four OSs. The results also hint at two approaches: (a) decouple the rendering pipelines of Java AWT/Swing from the JREs for faster upgrading and supporting old JREs and (b) use other graphics libraries, such as CWT, instead of Java AWT/Swing to develop cross-platform Java games with higher and more consistent rendering performance.

@article{Dit2013,
abstract = {In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Software maintainers frequently strive to locate source code related to specific software features. This situation is mostly observable when features are scattered in the code. Considering this problem, several approaches for feature location using execution traces have been developed. Nonetheless, the practice of post-mortem analysis based on execution traces is not fully incorporated in the daily practice of software maintainers. Empirical studies that reveal strengths and weaknesses on the use of execution traces in maintenance activities could better explain the role of execution traces in software maintenance. This study reports on a controlled experiment conducted with maintainers performing actual maintenance activities on systems of different sizes unknown to them. There are benefits from systematic use of execution traces: the reduction of the maintenance activity time and greater accuracy of the activity outcome. Other qualitative observations were the lower level of activity difficulty perceived by the participants that used execution trace information and that this kind of information seems to be less useful in maintenance activities where the problem of feature scattering does not occur clearly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Therefore, programmers require support in finding relevant functions and determining how those functions are used. Unfortunately, existing code search engines do not provide enough of this support to developers, thus reducing the effectiveness of code reuse. We provide this support to programmers in a code search system called Portfolio that retrieves and visualizes relevant functions and their usages. We have built Portfolio using a combination of models that address surfing behavior of programmer and sharing Related concepts among functions. We conducted an experiment with 49 professional programmers to compare Portfolio to Google Code Search and Koders using a standard methodology. The results show with strong statistical significance that users find more relevant functions with higher precision with Portfolio than with Google Code Search and Koders.},

Few researches are conducted on security for SCADA broadcasting system, but these are limited to end-to-end designs and developments. The security developments for multicasting and broadcasting systems are much complicated, time consumed and/or overloaded with the cryptography mechanisms. After conducting the detail survey, a simulation environment for SCADA water pumping system is designed in-which number of nodes is configured and well known cryptography algorithms are selected, and deployed as an inclusive development for SCADA/DNP3 broadcasting system. The inclusive security development is considered with the best performance, and with predominant weakness in mind, which are present in SCADA/ DNP3 broadcasting system. However, overall communication is initiated, monitored and controlled at main controller side with the user defined human machine interface (HMI).},

The wide deployment of IoT devices and the pressure of time to market of device development have raised security and privacy concerns. In order to help better understand the se- curity vulnerabilities of existing IoT devices and pro- mote the development of low-cost IoT security meth- ods, in this paper, we use both commercial and indus- trial IoT devices as examples from which the security of hardware, software, and networks are analyzed and backdoors are identified. A detailed security analysis procedure will be elaborated on a home automation system and a smart meter proving that security vul- nerabilities are a common problem for most devices. Security solutions and mitigation methods will also be discussed to help IoT manufacturers secure their products.},

They may hinder the evolution of a system by making it hard for software engineers to carry out changes. We propose three contributions to the research field related to code and design smells: (1) DECOR, a method that embodies and defines all the steps necessary for the specification and detection of code and design smells, (2) DETEX, a detection technique that instantiates this method, and (3) an empirical validation in terms of precision and recall of DETEX. The originality of DETEX stems from the ability for software engineers to specify smells at a high level of abstraction using a consistent vocabulary and domain-specific language for automatically generating detection algorithms. Using DETEX, we specify four well-known design smells: the antipatterns Blob, Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife, and their 15 underlying code smells, and we automatically generate their detection algorithms. We apply and validate the detection algorithms in terms of precision and recall on XERCES v2.7.0, and discuss the precision of these algorithms on 11 open-source systems.},

abstract = {Vulnerability assessment is a requirement of NERC's cybersecurity standards for electric power systems. The purpose is to study the impact of a cyber attack on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Compliance of the require- ment to meet the standard has become increasingly challenging as the system becomes more dispersed in wide areas. Interdepen- dencies between computer communication system and the phys- ical infrastructure also become more complex as information tech- nologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systemat- ically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: system, scenarios, and access points. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its po- tential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks. Countermeasures are identified for improvement of the cybersecurity.},

abstract = {—The challenge of inferring state machines from log data or execution traces is well-established, and has led to the development of several powerful techniques. Current approaches tend to focus on the inference of conventional finite state machines or, in few cases, state machines with guards. However, these ma-chines are ultimately only partial, because they fail to model how any underlying variables are computed during the course of an execution; they are not computational. In this paper we introduce a technique based upon Genetic Programming to infer these data transformation functions, which in turn render inferred automata fully computational. Instead of merely determining whether or not a sequence is possible, they can be simulated, and be used to compute the variable values throughout the course of an execution. We demonstrate the approach by using a Cross-Validation study to reverse-engineer complete (computational) EFSMs from traces of established implementations.},

abstract = {When reusing an existing software component, the software developer needs to understand the functionality and possible extension points of the component, as well as constraints and rules to be taken into account when using it. In addition to structural rules, the software component may imply interaction rules that must be followed in application development. In this paper we discuss behavioral profiles, given in UML, used to capture and illustrate architecturally significant behavioral rules. The behavioral rules may capture interaction rules to be obeyed when reusing an existing software component. They can also be used to support runtime analysis of existing systems: with a proper tool support, the validity of extracted interaction models can be automatically checked against the behavioral rules given in the profiles. Moreover, the profiles can be used to prune the size of the interaction trace to include only the information relevant from the point of view of the behavioral rules. In this paper we discuss such tool support and demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying behavioral profiles to define and illustrate behavioral rules relevant for applications using the graphical editing framework (GEF). Moreover, we analyze a sample GEF application by validating its run-time behaviour with respect to the defined behavioral rules},

abstract = {Illegal code reuse has become a serious threat to the software community. Identifying similar or identical code fragments becomes much more challenging in code theft cases where plagiarizers can use various automated code transformation or obfuscation techniques to hide stolen code from being detected. Previous works in this field are largely limited in that (i) most of them cannot handle advanced obfuscation techniques, and (ii) the methods based on source code analysis are not practical since the source code of suspicious programs typically cannot be obtained until strong evidences have been collected. Based on the observation that some critical runtime values of a program are hard to be replaced or eliminated by semantics-preserving transformation techniques, we introduce a novel approach to dynamic characterization of executable programs. Leveraging such invariant values, our technique is resilient to various control and data obfuscation techniques. We show how the values can be extracted and refined to expose the critical values and how we can apply this runtime property to help solve problems in software plagiarism detection. We have implemented a prototype with a dynamic taint analyzer atop a generic processor emulator. Our value-based plagiarism detection method (VaPD) uses the longest common subsequence based similarity measuring algorithms to check whether two code fragments belong to the same lineage. We evaluate our proposed method through a set of real-world automated obfuscators. Our experimental results show that the value-based method successfully discriminates 34 plagiarisms obfuscated by SandMark, plagiarisms heavily obfuscated by KlassMaster, programs obfuscated by Thicket, and executables obfuscated by Loco/Diablo.},

abstract = {One of the most important steps towards effective software maintenance of a large complicated system is to understand how program features are spread over the entire system and their interactions with the program components. However, we must first be able to represent an abstract feature in terms of some concrete program components. In this paper, we use an execution slice-based technique to identify the basic blocks which are used to implement a program feature. Three metrics are then defined, based on this identification, to determine quantitatively, the disparity between a program component and a feature, the concentration of a feature in a program component, and the dedication of a program component to a feature. The computations of these metrics are automated by incorporating them in a tool ($\chi$Suds), which makes the use of our metrics immediately applicable in real-life contexts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by experimenting with a reliability and performance evaluator. Results of our study suggest that these metrics can provide an indication of the closeness between a feature and a program component which is very useful for software programmers and maintainers to better understand the system at hand.},

Current EMS state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data, based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods can detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. To the authors best knowledge, this is the first such experimental study.

abstract = {During the last decade with the growth of cyber attacks, information safety has become an important issue all over the world. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are an essential element for network security infrastructure and play a very important role in detecting large number of attacks. Although there are different types of intrusion detection systems, all these systems suffer a common problem which is generating high volume of alerts and huge number of false positives. This drawback has become the main motivation for many research papers in IDS area. The aim of conducted research in the field is to propose different techniques to handle the alerts, reduce them and distinguish real attacks from false positives and low importance events. This manuscript is a survey paper that represents a review of the current research related to the false positives problem. The focus will be on data mining techniques of alert reduction. This paper reviews more than 30 related studies during the last decade with the hope of providing a reference for further research in this area. Several open issues have also been addressed in this paper.},

abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are used to monitor computer systems for signs of security violations. Having detected such signs, IDSs trigger alerts to report them. These alerts are presented to a human analyst, who evaluates them and initiates an adequate response. In practice, IDSs have been observed to trigger thousands of alerts per day, most of which are mistakenly triggered by benign events (i.e., false positives). This makes it extremely difficult for the analyst to correctly identify alerts related to attacks (i.e., true positives). In this paper, we present two orthogonal and complementary approaches to reduce the number of false positives in intrusion detection using alert postprocessing by data mining and machine learning. Moreover, these two techniques, because of their complementary nature, can be used together in an alert-management system. These concepts have been verified on a variety of data sets, and achieved a significant reduction in the number of false positives in both simulated and real environments. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The combination of these two experts is empirically evaluated through several case studies, which use the source code of the Mozilla Web browser and the Eclipse integrated development environment. The results show that the combination of experts significantly improves the effectiveness of feature location as compared to each of the experts used independently.},

abstract = {Feature identification is a technique to identify the source code constructs activated when exercising one of the features of a program. We propose new statistical analyses of static and dynamic data to accurately identify features in large multithreaded object-oriented programs. We draw inspiration from epidemiology to improve previous approaches to feature identification and develop an epidemiological metaphor. We build our metaphor on our previous approach to feature identification, in which we use processor emulation, knowledge-based filtering, probabilistic ranking, and metamodeling. We carry out three case studies to assess the usefulness of our metaphor, using the "save a bookmark" feature of Web browsers as an illustration. In the first case study, we compare our approach with three previous approaches (a naive approach, a concept analysis-based approach, and our previous probabilistic approach) in identifying the feature in MOZILLA, a large, real-life, multithreaded object-oriented program. In the second case study, we compare the implementation of the feature in the FIREFOX and MOZILLA Web browsers. In the third case study, we identify the same feature in two more Web browsers, Chimera (in C) and ICEBrowser (in Java), and another feature in JHOTDRAW and XFIG, to highlight the generalizability of our metaphor},

The former have the advantage of attack specificity, but may not be able to generalize. The latter detect attacks probabilistically, allowing for generalization potential. However, they lack attack models and can potentially learn to consider an attack normal. Herein, we present a high-performance, adaptive, model-based technique for attack detection, using Bayes net technology to analyze bursts of traffic. Attack classes are embodied as model hypotheses, which are adaptively reinforced. This approach has the attractive features of both signature based and statistical techniques: model specificity, adaptability, and generalization potential. Our initial prototype sensor examines TCP headers and communicates in IDIP, delivering a complementary inference technique to an IDS sensor suite. The inference technique is itself suitable for sensor correlation.},

With the constantly growing number of internet related computer attacks, there is evidence that our critical infrastructure may also be vulnerable. Researchers estimate that malicious online actions may cause {\$}75 billion at 2007. One of the interesting countermeasures for enhancing information system security is called intrusion detection. This paper will briefly discuss the history of research in intrusion detection techniques and introduce the two basic detection approaches: signature detection and anomaly detection. Finally, it presents the application of techniques developed for monitoring critical process systems, such as nuclear power plants, to anomaly intrusion detection. The method uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model coupled with the statistical probability ratio test (SPRT) and applied to a simulated SCADA system. The results show that these methods can be generally used to detect a variety of common attacks.},

abstract = {The continuous growth of cyber security threat s and attacks including the increasing sophistication of malware is impacting the security of critical infrastructure, industrial control systems, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control systems. The reliable operation of modern infrastructures depends on computerized systems and SCADA systems. Since the emergence of Internet and World Wide Web technologies, these systems were integrated with business systems and became more exposed to cyber threats. There is a growing concern about the security and safety of the SCADA control systems. The Presidential Decision Directive 63 document est ablished the framework to protect the critical infrastruct ure an d the Presidential document of 2003, the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace stated that securing SCADA systems is a national priority. T he critical infrastructure includes telecommunication, transportation, energy, banking, finance, water supply, emergency services, government services, agriculture, an d other fundamental systems and services that are critical to the security, economic prosperity, and social well-being of the public. The critical infrastructure is characterized by interdependencies (physical, cyber, geographic, and logical) and complexity (collections of interacting components). Therefore, information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems without exception. Critical infrastructure disruptions can directly an d indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions, an d send ripples throughout the national an d global economy. For example, under normal operating conditions, the electric power in frastructure requires fuels (natural gas and petroleum), transportation, water, banking and finance, telecommunication, and SCADA systems for monitoring and control. In this paper, we provide an analysis of key developments, architecture, potential vulnerabilities, and security concerns including recommendations toward improving security for SCADA control systems. We discuss the most important issues concerning the security of SCADA systems including a perspective on enhancing security of these systems. We briefly describe the SCADA architecture, and identify t he attributes that increase the complexity of these systems including the key developments that mark the evolution of the SCADA control systems along with the growth of potential vulnerabilities and security concerns. Then, we provide recommendations toward an enhanced security for SCADA control systems. More efforts should be planned on reducing the vulnerabilities and improving the security operations of these systems. It is necessary to address not only t he individual vulnerabilit ies, but the breadth of risks that can interfere with critical operations. We describe key requirements and features needed to improve the security of t he current SCADA control systems. For example, in assessing the risk for SCADA systems, use of general methods for risk analysis including specific conditions and characteristics of a control system need to be applied. Effective risk analysis for SCADA systems requires a unified definition for mishap an d identification of potential harm to safety. As computer systems are more integrated, the distinction between security and safety is beginning to disappear. In bridging the gap between these domains, we propose a unified risk framework which combines a new definition of mishap with an expanded definition of hazard to include the security event. However, methods for risk management that are based on automated tools and intelligent techniques are more beneficial to SCADA systems because they require minimum or no human intervention in controlling the processes. We also identify a unified security/safety risk framework for control systems. Implementing security features ensures higher security, reliability, an d availability of control systems. Thus organizations need to reassess the SCADA control systems an d risk model to achieve in depth defense solutions for these systems. The increasing threats against SCADA control systems indicate that there should be more directions in the development of these systems. Therefore, achieving better quality an d more secure SCADA control systems is a high priority. Information security management principles and processes need to be applied to SCADA systems with out exception. We conclude with a thought about the future of SCADA control systems. A strategy to deal with cyber attacks against the nation's critical infrastructure requires first understanding the full nature of the threat. A depth defense and proactive solutions to improve the security of SCADA control systems ensures the future of control systems and survivability of critical infrastructure.},

abstract = {Finite state machine-derived specifications such as X-machines, extended finite state machines and abstract state machines, are an established means to model software behaviour. They allow for comprehensive testing of an implementation in terms of its intended behaviour. In practice however they are rarely generated and maintained during software development, hence their benefits can rarely be exploited. We address this problem by using an interactive grammar inference technique to infer the underlying state machine representation of an existing software system. The approach is interactive because it generates queries to the user as it constructs a hypothesis machine, which can be interpreted as system tests. This paper describes (1) how an existing grammar inference technique (QSM) can be used to reverse-engineer state-based models of software from execution traces at a developer-defined level of abstraction and (2) how the QSM technique can be improved for a better balance between the number of tests it proposes and the accuracy of the machine it derives. The technique has been implemented, which has enabled us to present a small case study of its use with respect to a real software system, along with some preliminary performance results.},

These efforts have resulted in a large research body of which currently there exists no comprehensive overview. This paper reports on a systematic literature survey aimed at the identification and structuring of research on program comprehension through dynamic analysis. From a research body consisting of 4,795 articles published in 14 relevant venues between July 1999 and June 2008 and the references therein, we have systematically selected 172 articles and characterized them in terms of four main facets: activity, target, method, and evaluation. The resulting overview offers insight in what constitutes the main contributions of the field, supports the task of identifying gaps and opportunities, and has motivated our discussion of several important research directions that merit additional consideration in the near future.},

abstract = {Nowadays, industrial control systems operators are trying to fulfill requirements from upcoming standards and regulation regarding cyber security issues. However, addressing such security requirements by implementing security measures is not a trivial task. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of the configuration for the security measures is prone to error. This research shows that it is possible to derive configuration file(s) to setup different security measures based on the input from system description files. In addition, we highlight an important anomaly in industrial control systems, namely the missing/tardiness of expected traffic. In this paper, we show how the proposed system works by taking IEC 61850 SCD files and generating configuration files for security measures such as firewall and IDS/IPS. Additionally, current IDS/IPS only raise an alert when unexpected traffic appears in the system. They do not alert on the disappearance of the expected traffic. In fact, this type of anomaly is as critical as the other type of anomaly. Thus, we address this anomaly as well in our research.},

OCSVM (One-Class Support Vector Machine) is an intrusion detection mechanism that does not need any labeled data for training or any information about the kind of anomaly is expecting for the detection process. This feature makes it ideal for processing SCADA environment data and automate SCADA performance monitoring. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project and communicates with the other parts of the system by the exchange of IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) messages that carry information about the source of the incident, the time and a classification of the alarm.},

The aim is to detect attacks composed of a set of SCADA commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed firewall detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. Furthermore, we detail the design of the architecture of the firewall for systems that use the ModBus and DNP3 protocols, and the implementation of a prototype, providing experimental comparative results that confirm the validity of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {False positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) happen in every Intrusion Detection System (IDS). How often they occur is regarded as a measurement of the accuracy of the system. Frequent occurrences of FPs not only reduce the throughput of an IDS as FPs block the normal traffic and also degrade its trustworthiness. It is also difficult to eradicate all FNs from an IDS. One way to overcome the shortcomings of a single IDS is to employ multiple IDSs in its place and leverage the different capabilities and domain knowledge of these systems. Nonetheless, making a correct intrusion decision based on the outcomes of multiple IDSs has been a challenging task, as different IDSs may respond differently to the same packet trace. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce FPs and FNs by applying a creditability-based weighted voting (CWV) scheme to the outcomes of multiple IDSs. First, the CWV scheme evaluates the creditability of each individual IDS by monitoring its response to a large collection of pre-recorded packet traces containing various types of intrusions. For each IDS, our scheme then assigns different weights to each intrusion type according to its FP and FN ratios. Later, after their operations, the outcomes of individual IDSs are merged using a weighted voting scheme. In benchmarking tests, our CWV-based multiple IDSs demonstrated significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency when compared with multiple IDSs employing an ordinary majority voting (MV) scheme. The accuracy is the percentage of whole traces that are determined accurately, while the efficiency indicates that the voting algorithm performs better on reducing both FP and FN ratios. The CWV scheme achieved 95{\%} accuracy and 94{\%} efficiency while the MV scheme produced only 66{\%} accuracy and 41{\%} efficiency; the average percentages of FP/FN reduction were 21{\%} and 58{\%} respectively. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Explicitly stated program invariants can help programmers by characterizing certain aspects of program execution and identifying program properties that must be preserved when modifying code. Unfortunately, these invariants are usually absent from code. Previous work showed how to dynamically detect invariants from program traces by looking for patterns in and relationships among variable values. A prototype implementation, Daikon, accurately recovered invariants from formally-specified programs, and the invariants it detected in other programs assisted programmers in a software evolution task. However, Daikon suffered from reporting too many invariants, many of which were not useful, and also failed to report some desired invariants. The paper presents, and gives experimental evidence of the efficacy of, four approaches for increasing the relevance of invariants reported by a dynamic invariant detector. One of them (exploiting unused polymorphism), adds desired invariants to the output. The other three (suppressing implied invariants, limiting which variables are compared to one another, and ignoring unchanged values), eliminate undesired invariants from the output and also improve runtime by reducing the work done by the invariant detector},

abstract = {—Computer-aided design (CAD), in its quest to facil-itate new design revolutions, is again on the brink of changing its scope. Following both historical and recent technological and application trends, one can identify several emerging research and development directions in which CAD approaches and techniques may have major impacts. Among them, due to the potential to fundamentally alter everyday life as well as how science and engineering systems are designed and operated, the Internet of Things (IoT) stands out. IoT also poses an extraordinary system replete with conceptual and technical challenges. For instance, greatly reduced quantitative bounds on acceptable area and energy metrics require qualitative breakthroughs in design and optimization techniques. Most likely the most demanding of requirements for the widespread realization of many IoT visions is security. IoT secu-rity has an exceptionally wide scope in at least four dimensions. In terms of security scope it includes rarely addressed tasks such as trusted sensing, computation, communication, privacy, and digital forgetting. It also asks for new and better techniques for the protection of hardware, software, and data that considers the possibility of physical access to IoT devices. Sensors and actuators are common components of IoT devices and pose several unique security challenges including the integrity of physical signals and actuating events. Finally, during processing of collected data, one can envision many semantic attacks. Our strategic objective is to provide an impetus for the development of IoT CAD security techniques. We start by presenting a brief survey of IoT challenges and opportunities with an emphasis on security issues. Next, we discuss the potential of hardware-based IoT security approaches. Finally, we conclude with several case studies that advocate the use of stable PUFs and digital PPUFs for several IoT security protocols.},

We hypothesize that these techniques, which rely on making binary judgments about a code element's relevance to a feature, are overly sensitive to the quality of the input. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a more robust alternative, whose most distinguishing characteristic is that it employs ranking heuristics to determine a code element's relevance to a feature. We believe that our technique is less sensitive with respect to the quality of the input and we claim that it is more effective when used by developers unfamiliar with the target system. We validate our claim by applying our technique to three systems with comprehensive test suites. A developer unfamiliar with the target system spent a limited amount of effort preparing the test suite for analysis. Our results show that under these circumstances our ranking-based technique compares favorably to a technique based on binary judgements.},

abstract = {In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

However, there are not enough security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets. For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach will provide significant contributions to attract attention to vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems.},

abstract = {Malware analysis is the process of determining the purpose and functionality of a given malware sample (such as a virus,worm, orTrojan horse). This process is a necessary step to be able to develop effective detection techniques for malicious code. In addition, it is an important prerequisite for the development of removal tools that can thoroughly delete malware from an infected machine. Traditionally, malware analysis has been a manual process that is tedious and time- intensive. Unfortunately, the number of samples that need to be analyzed by security vendors on a daily basis is constantly increasing. This clearly reveals the need for tools that auto- mate and simplify parts of the analysis process. In this paper, we present TTAnalyze, a tool for dynamically analyzing the behavior of Windows executables. To this end, the binary is run in an emulated operating system environment and its (security-relevant) actions are monitored. In particular, we record the Windows native system calls and Windows API functions that the program invokes. One important feature of our system is that it does not modify the program that it executes (e.g., through API call hooking or breakpoints), makingitmoredifficult todetectbymalicious code. Also, our tool runs binaries in an unmodified Windows environment, which leads to excellent emulation accuracy. These factors make TTAnalyze an ideal tool for quickly understanding the behavior of an unknown malware.},
